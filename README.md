### Abstract of the paper: 

There is a growing interest in analyzing high-dimensional count data, which often exhibit quasi-sparsity corresponding to an over-abundance of zeros and small non-zero counts. Existing
approaches for analyzing multivariate count data via Poisson or negative binomial log-linear hierarchical models with zero-inflation cannot flexibly adapt to quasi-sparse settings. We develop
a new class of continuous local-global shrinkage priors tailored for quasi-sparse counts. Theoretical propertzes are assessed, including flexible posterior concentration and stronger control on
false discoveries in multiple testing. Simulation studies illustrate excellent small-sample properties relative to competitors. We apply the method to detect rare mutational hotspots in exome
sequencing data and to identify US cities most impacted by terrorism.
